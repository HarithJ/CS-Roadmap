Include link to awesome MOOC courses under courses section that would enable someone to gain enough skills to become a great programmer.


# CORE Programming

## Required
### Introduction to CS
This course is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. It teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets are inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.

### DataStructures
This course is a survey of fundamental data structures for information processing, including lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. It explores the implementation of these data structures (both array-based and linked representations) and examines classic algorithms that use these structures for tasks such as sorting, searching, and text compression. The Java programming language is used to demonstrate the topics discussed; and key notions of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation and abstract data types, are emphasized.

## Electives

### Introduction to R
This course is an introduction to the fundamental principles of programming computers using the R programming language. Intended for students with no previous coding experience, this course covers the fundamental concepts that underly all modern programming languages including variables, types, functions, conditional branching, iteration, files, and data structures. At the same time, we examine many of the idioms specific to R. Special attention is focused on skills of particular utility for data science, such as packages, data management and transformation, graphics, and text processing. Assignments are developed in the popular R notebook format, allowing for integration of code, output, and graphics, with an emphasis on reproducible analysis.

### Unix/Linux Systems programming
As an introduction to the fundamental structure and services of the Unix and Linux operating systems, this course combines theory with programming at the system call level. Topics include files and directories, device control, terminal handling, processes and threads, signals, pipes, and sockets. Examples and exercises include directory management utilities, a shell, and a web server.

### Introduction to C, Unix/Linux Programming, and Web Interfaces
Designed for students with some programming experience, this course provides a rigorous introduction to writing and using software tools in the Unix and GNU/Linux programming environments to build command-line and web-based programs. The course teaches students how to write C programs and Unix shell scripts, and how to create web interfaces to those programs. Topics include text processing, memory management, files and pipes, and processes and protocols. Students write programs to analyze data and generate reports, use shell scripts to combine tools into applications, and use HTML, CGI, and Ajax to provide web access to those applications and data.

### Database Systems
This course covers the fundamental concepts of database systems. Topics include data models (ER, relational, and others); query languages (relational algebra, SQL, and others); implementation techniques of database management systems (index structures, concurrency control, recovery, and query processing); management of semistructured and complex data; distributed and noSQL databases.

### Designing and Developing Relational and Non-Relational Databases
This course focuses on the design and development of database applications with an emphasis on sound database design. Database design is a business problem, not a data problem. To successfully design a database, the analyst needs to understand the information of the organization. This includes using all the data research and analysis techniques available, as well as searching inside their toolbox to select those tools that allow the analyst to understand the business the organization is in. Information is data within a particular context. Thus, if the person understands the information required by the organization, he/she will be able to organize the data in such a way that answers the questions required by the organization. Although governed by a number of rules and standards, database design is an art. Only practice allows an individual to learn what suits each particular need. This course covers database design, including how to select the best database for the task at hand. Relational databases and non-relational databases each have their strengths and weaknesses, and this course explains the different types and when to use, or not use, them.

### Software Testing and TDD
In this course we review the traditional software testing techniques that are applicable to any software product, as well as learn techniques for testing object-oriented software and graphical user interface testing. The agile development paradigm of test-driven development is discussed. We also discover how innovative companies are able to build testing and quality into every stage of the development process and deliver a multitude of releases with a relatively small testing organization. We practice test creation and testing techniques through discussions and individual and group projects. Concepts covered include test cycles, testing objectives, testing in the software development process, types of software errors, reporting and analyzing software errors, problem tracking systems, test case design, testing tools, test planning, test documentation, and managing a test group.
